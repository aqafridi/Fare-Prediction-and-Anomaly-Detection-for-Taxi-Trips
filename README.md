# Fare Prediction and Anomaly Detection for Yellow Taxi Trips

This project aims to build a machine learning system for predicting the total fare amount for yellow taxi trips in New York City and detecting potential anomalies or fraudulent trip records. The system leverages advanced regression modeling techniques for fare prediction and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms.

## Dataset

The project uses the 2021 Yellow Taxi Trip Data dataset, which includes information about taxi trips in NYC, such as pickup and dropoff times, locations, passenger counts, fare details, and more. The dataset can be obtained from the [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).

## Features

- **Fare Prediction:** A regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Network) is developed to predict the total fare amount based on features like trip distance, passenger count, pickup and dropoff locations, and more.
- **Anomaly Detection:** An unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoder) is implemented to identify potential anomalies or outliers in the trip data, which could indicate fraudulent or erroneous records.
- **Feature Engineering:** New features are created by combining or transforming existing features, such as calculating trip duration, deriving day of the week, time of day, and geographic features.
- **Model Deployment:** The trained models are containerized using Docker and deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) with a RESTful API or serverless function for serving predictions.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Mechanisms for monitoring the deployed models' performance, detecting issues, and facilitating model retraining or updates are implemented.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aqafridi/Fare-Prediction-and-Anomaly-Detection-for-Taxi-Trips.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Docker).

3. Follow the instructions in the `docs` directory to set up the project environment, preprocess the data, train the models, and deploy the system.
